    And, the key point is: if you only or even fail to make ends meet after any winning round, 
    you may stuck in this loop for good.
    
    So, every winning round SHOULD ensure net profit.
    
    To avoid this, for winning case of every round, we have to make a bet that earns us more than what we have spent.
    That is, bet z coins for z is the smallest value such that z * (k - 1) > loss.
    
    As for losing case, check if you can afford the bet.

    If we managed to pay the bet in every round till the (x + 1) round ends, 
    we'll surely get infinitive coins as we repeat this procedure.

  ```c++
    int main () {
        int t;  cin >> t;
        while(t--) {
            int k, x;  
            ll a, bet = 1, loss = 0;
            cin >> k >> x >> a;
            bool flag = true;
            for (int i = 0; i <= x; i++) {
                loss += bet;
                bet = loss / (k - 1) + 1;
                if (a < loss) {
                    flag = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (flag) cout << "YES\n";
            else cout << "NO\n";
        }
    }
  ```
