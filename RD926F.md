    A rather straight forward problem. Just some implementation issues.

    Easy to flatten the tree to an ascending array.
    It may look like: 1, 2, -1, -1, 8, -1, 10, 11, -1
    For any known L, R, and the x unknown values in the midst, we have C(R - L + x, x) possibles cases.
    
    How do we come up with this combination?
    Consider it like this: we are picking x numbers in the range of [L, R].
    It's like | | 1 2 | 8 | 10 11
    Put a pole(|) in front of a number means this number is chosen.
    (Note that the last number shouldn't have a pole behind it.)
    In this case, we chose 1, 1, 8, 10.
    So, R - L + 1 numbers, x poles => C(R - L + 1 - 1 + x, x).

    Now we know we want this combination, but how to calculate it?
    Any combination C(n, k) can be expanded as n(n - 1)...(n - k + 1) / k(k - 1)...1
    So we calculate the numerator U, and the denominator D with a loop. (don't forget to mod)

    And here comes the problem: we want the modulo inverse of D, not D itself.
    This is where Fermat's little theorem helps.
    This theorem says that if p is a prime number, then a^p ≡ a (mod p).
    Devide both side with a and we got this: a^(p - 1) ≡ 1.
    And thus a * a^(p - 2) ≡ 1.

    So, the modulo inverse of a is a^(p - 2).
    With fast power we can easily calculate D^(p - 2).
    
    Multiply all the combinations, then that's it!
