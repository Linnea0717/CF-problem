    The problem is actually like:
    
    arr:  a  b  c  d  e  f  g
         ---------------------
               ---------------
                  ------------
                           ---
    
    So all's about which suffixs to add.
    That is, add all positive suffixs.

    From the 63th digit to the 0th digit, calculate the cost to make all elements' that digit on.
    And update every elements' value if modified.

    Essentailly the same idea as D1, but try to make every iteration O(1) rather than O(n).
    
    For a_i already has ith digit on (has ans | (1 << i) as its subset), no cost.  
    For a_i does not have ith digit on, but still has some digits lower than i on,
        (ans|(1 << i) not its subset, but ans is its subset), cost is (1 << i) - a_i % (1 << i).  
    For the rest (neither ans|(1 << i) nor ans is its subset), cost is (1 << i).  
  
    In conclusion, for those *does not* have ans|(1 << i) as subset, cost + (1 << i).  
    And those *does* have ans as subset but *not* ans|(1 << i), cost - a % (1 << i).

    So we need two vector s and t.
    s[x] is the number of (ai)s which has x as a subset.
    t[x][j] is the sum of (ai % 2^j) for all ai which has x as a subset.

    How we are going to construct s and t is by "sos dp".
    Let dp[x][f] be: the number of (ai)s that has x as a subset, and only differs with x in last f digits.
    For example, dp[101001][3] will only have 101001, 101011, 101101, 101111 into account.
    
    So we can see that, dp[x][f] = dp[x][f - 1] + dp[x | (1 << i)][f - 1].
    The former corresponds to cases in which the fth digit is the same.
    While the latter corresponds to cases in which the fth digit is changed from 0 to 1.
    
    After doing memery optimisation, s[x] += s[x | (1 << i)], t[x][j] += t[x | (1 << i)][j].

    Also, base cases for s are those ai that *does not* differ with x.
    That is, every a == x.
    Base cases for t quite the same, (ai % 2^j) for every ai every j.

    In addition, as there may be ks that are so big, that can change all a into number bigger than 10^6 (2^20).
    We should treat these cases differently by precalculate the cost of achieving 10^6.

    Suppose that there are three dots, A(x, y), B(z, w), O(0, 0).
    Now OA = x^2 + y^2, OB = z^2 + w^2,
    AB = (x - z)^2 + (y - w)^2 = OA - 2xz + OB - 2yw
    Let's see what AB is like when OA and OB are odd or even.

    If OA = 2k, OB = 2t:
      AB = 2k + 2t - 2xz - 2yw  easily seen even.
    If OA = 2k + 1, OB = 2t:
      AB = 2k + 1 + 2t - 2xz - 2yw  odd
    If OA = 2k + 1, OB = 2t + 1:
      AB = 2k + 2t + 2 - 2xz - 2yw  even

    So, when OA and OB both odd or both even, AB is even; otherwise AB is odd.
    In other words, AB's parity is the same as (OA + OB)'s.
    
    That is to say, when there's multiple spots, going from O to P, 
    and going from O to A to B to ... to Q then endlich to P, 
    in these two cases, the parity of total square distance, are just the same.

    So the target is just to make sure that the square distance from S to the last spot has a parity favourable to myself.
    If there are more spots with odd square distance, choose to be Second; otherwise First.
