    There are two things to do:
    1. Know, for every edge, which pairs it will cover
    2. Dp to know how many edges to include to cover all pairs

    As we can see, there are no more than 20 pairs,
      clearly we use bitset to store the state of covered or uncovered.
      
      
    The first step has a quite cool approach:
      - A vector covers(n) to store the covering state of each edge
      Each pair, we are given the starting point u and the ending point v.
      Let u and v cover this pair for now.
      
      Note that by now we are assigning this pair to nodes, but not edges.
      How we are switching this to edge is by using tree structure:
        For each edge, we want the child node, rather than the parent node to claim it.

      Then we do a dfs:
        For a node x, and its children y(s).
        If, 1. Both x and one y covers pair i (cover[x][i] = 1, cover[y][i] = 1),
                  then this pair must be the edge connecting x and y.
                  As we designed, assign the edge to y. Thus only y covers pair i. (0)
            2. One y covers pair i, but x doesn't (cover[x][i] = 0, cover[y][i] = 1),
                  which means, pair i extend to x, and not yet reaches an end point.
                  Then the edge from x to its parent must also be between pair i.
                  Thus x also covers pair i. (1)
            3. Only x covers pair i, none of the y(s) do (cover[x][i] = 1, cover[y][i] = 0),
                  then x, being the child on the edge from x to its parent, covers pair i.  (1)
            4. Otherwise (cover[x][i] = 0, cover[y][i] = 0), no pair covered (0)
            
        Notice something? It's XOR!
        Just covers[x] ^= covers[y] for every y.


      As for the second step,
        you can't just loop through (mask from 0 to 2^k) and (c from covers[1] to covers[n]),
        as O(2^k TN) will give you TLE.
        
      So what we do is:
        Still we loop through (mask from 0 to 2^k).
        For each mask, we look for its lowest 0 bit, and see if some candidates in covers can cover this bit.
          (Feel free to leave the rest 0 bits to later masks.)
        Thus, we need to know for each bit (0 to k-1), which edge can cover it.

        We prepare a vector of vectors cands(m).
        For each covers[x], if it has bit i on, this means this edge can cover pairs in x, including i.
        Add x to cands[i].

        Now we are fully prepared.
        For each mask, find its lowest 0 bit (idx).
        Look for cand in cands[idx], and see if including this cand (edge) is more preferable.
        That is, dp[mask | cand] = min(dp[mask | cand], dp[mask] + 1).

      Hurra! dp[(1 << k) - 1] for you!


      p.s.
      One more thing that may do some optimization:
      3. discard those edges that cover only pairs that another edge can fully cover
      
      This can be done such way:
        Prepare covered[mask] to indicates if there exist a set of edges with covering state 'mask'.
        Initially all covered[ cover[x] ] are true.

        When you look for the candidates, for each covers[x],
          go through the k bits of it.
        If there exist a 0 bit, and covered[x + that bit] is on,
          this means covered[x] can be discarded.  Skip it.
        If not skipped, just do the ordinary cands process.
