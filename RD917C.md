    Easily seen that if we start with a = {0, 0, ..., 0}, the maximum score d / 2 is achieved by alternate reset and addition.
    So the target is to decide when to reset a to all zeros for the first time? How many cases to enumerate?
    For the first reset, obviously we can only get at most n scores. When will the all-zeros approach outperform it?
    After 2n days, the all-zeros approach will get n scores. So, only enumerate cases where first reset is earlier than 2n + 1 days.

  ```c++
  int main () {
      ios::sync_with_stdio(false); cin.tie(0);
      int t;  cin >> t;
      while (t--) {
          int n, k, d;  cin >> n >> k >> d;
          vector<int> a(n + 1), v(k);
          int score = 0, maxscore = 0;
          for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
              cin >> a[i];
              if (a[i] == i) score++;
          }
          for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) cin >> v[i];
          
          for (int day = 0; day <= min(2 * n, d - 1); day++) {  // accumulate for days, reset on day+1
              maxscore = max(maxscore, score + (d - day - 1) / 2);
  
              int idx = day % k; 
              for (int j = 1; j <= v[idx]; j++) {
                  if (a[j] == j) score--;
                  a[j]++;
                  if (a[j] == j) score++;
              }            
          }
          cout << maxscore << '\n';
      }
  }
