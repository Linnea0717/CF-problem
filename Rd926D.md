  <summary>solution</summary>

    Just a tree dp.
    Dp[x] for the number of non-empty sets in the subtree rooted at x, 
    in which no vertices has anscestor-descendant relation.
    
    For dp[x], you can choose a set or an empty set from each of x's subtree.
    And when you add x to *the set of sets*, here a valid answer for you.  Thus ans += dp[x].
    Yet of course we don't actually add x to the set as it doesn't satisfy our dp rules (no anscestor),
    you just pass the set of some sets of x's subtrees to x's parent.

    But when do we actually add x to a set in dp[x]? When you choose empty sets from all x's subtree!
    In this case, this new set contains only x itself, and does not violate any dp rule.
    
    Thus, dp[x] = (dp[y1] + 1) * (dp[y2] + 1) * ... * (dp[yn] + 1).

    Easily seen that sum(dp[i]) should be the answer.

  ```c++  
  const ll mod = 998244353;
  
  ll dfs(vector<vector<int>>& link, ll& ans, int par, int x) {
      ll sum = 1;
      for (int y: link[x]) {
          if (y == par) continue;
          ll cur = dfs(link, ans, x, y);
          sum *= cur + 1;        sum %= mod;
      }
      ans += sum;  ans %= mod;
      return sum;
  }
  
  int main () {
      int t;  cin >> t;
      while (t--) {
          int n;  cin >> n;
          vector<vector<int>> link(n + 1);
          for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
              int u, v;  cin >> u >> v;
              link[u].emplace_back(v);
              link[v].emplace_back(u);
          }
          ll ans = 0;
          dfs(link, ans, 0, 1);
          cout << (ans + 1) % mod << '\n';
      }
  }
  ```
