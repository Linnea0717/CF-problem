    Essentailly the same idea as D1, but try to make every iteration O(1) rather than O(n).
    
    For a_i already has ith digit on (has ans | (1 << i) as its subset), no cost.  
    For a_i does not have ith digit on, but still has some digits lower than i on,
        (ans|(1 << i) not its subset, but ans is its subset), cost is (1 << i) - a_i % (1 << i).  
    For the rest (neither ans|(1 << i) nor ans is its subset), cost is (1 << i).  
  
    In conclusion, for those *does not* have ans|(1 << i) as subset, cost + (1 << i).  
    And those *does* have ans as subset but *not* ans|(1 << i), cost - a % (1 << i).

    So we need two vector s and t.
    s[x] is the number of (ai)s which has x as a subset.
    t[x][j] is the sum of (ai % 2^j) for all ai which has x as a subset.

    How we are going to construct s and t is by "sos dp".
    Let dp[x][f] be: the number of (ai)s that has x as a subset, and only differs with x in last f digits.
    For example, dp[101001][3] will only have 101001, 101011, 101101, 101111 into account.
    
    So we can see that, dp[x][f] = dp[x][f - 1] + dp[x | (1 << i)][f - 1].
    The former corresponds to cases in which the fth digit is the same.
    While the latter corresponds to cases in which the fth digit is changed from 0 to 1.
    
    After doing memery optimisation, s[x] += s[x | (1 << i)], t[x][j] += t[x | (1 << i)][j].

    Also, base cases for s are those ai that *does not* differ with x.
    That is, every a == x.
    Base cases for t quite the same, (ai % 2^j) for every ai every j.

    In addition, as there may be ks that are so big, that can change all a into number bigger than 10^6 (2^20).
    We should treat these cases differently by precalculate the cost of achieving 10^6.
